## Hi. My name is Matt, and I think the world is ending.

If you're here, reading this now, there's a good chance you do too. If you don't, I'm not going to try and convince you. Whether you're here out of curiosity (morbid, academic, or otherwise), or because someone close to you sent you, if you're not here because you believe there is an urgent need to build resilient, sustainable, communities, this is not for you. It's not for you, but you're welcome all the same. My deepest wish is for this information to never be relevant to your (or anyone's) survival. My second deepest wish, failing that, is that the information contained here helps someone in the future.

Now, addressing those who are here for the same reason that I am: I want to build something with you.

**"What's that?"**, you ask.

The melodramatist in me wants to answer that by saying *"the future!"*. The nerd in me hopes you would get the reference if I told you that I wanted us to play the part of Hari Seldon from Asimov's Foundation in the context of our own modern society. The more reasonable part of me rolls my eyes at both of those, so I'll be more specific: I want to build a sustainable community that has the best chance we can give it to survive global economic collapse.

**"A community?"**, you probe further.

Yes. A community.

**"We?"**, you say with raised eyebrows.

Also yes. I need you. I can't do this alone.

**"Ok but how?"**, you inquire, with only a hint of incredulity.

I want to write a book with you.

**"That sounds like a dumb idea and I can't see how that might save anyone, let alone make a difference,"** you flatly declare.

Hear me out. Keep reading. It won't take long, but if I manage to convince you, it could make a world of difference. I believe that it has that potential. That's why I wrote it. It's why I'm asking you, even begging you, now, to give me a chance.

## A Blueprint, of Sorts

What we write together will be a blueprint for sustainable communities that have a real shot at surviving global economic collapse. If they survive, they will be the seeds of our future -- a future that you and I will hopefully still get to be a part of.

If that sounds grand or ambitious, we're not done yet. I don't want to build just one. I want to build as many as we can, while we can. As we get closer to the event horizon of this collapse, the demand for these communities will grow. If we're sincere about wanting to make a difference, we should try to help as many people as we can. We don't have to build them all ourselves. We need to write the blueprints. That, at least, is the starting point.

What I'm asking of you is time. If you're reading this, you probably have some. We don't need money -- not for this. Not yet. If you want to build the community that we plan, that will take money. To discover together what that community should look like -- to research, theorize, critique, and to write -- that will take time. Mine, and, I hope, yours as well.

If you're curious, read on a little further. I want to propose a methodology.

## This is [our] [post-apocalytic survival guide]. There are many like it, but this one is [ours].

Let's talk about what sets this endeavor apart. Let's talk about why you should contribute. Let's talk about how this can make a difference for more than just you and me.

It starts with a discussion of **constraints** as they relate to the plan that we're building. The first one looks kinda like...

**Constraint: Nuclear war is not something that is worth planning to survive, unless out of sheer luck.**

From a practical logistics standpoint, planning to survive a nuclear holocaust places it out of economic reach for most people, even collectively.

From a personal standpoint, I have no interest in spending the rest of my life surrounded by canned beans, ammunition, and nothing but my own company (or the company of my small, immediate family) with absolutely nothing to do but wait. The idea of living for any sustained period of time in an underground bunker, no matter how lavishly appointed, waiting for civilization to magically take root again in my lifetime without my help is not appealing to me. If the surface is uninhabitable, I'm ok with not inhabiting any of it. It's probably the kinder fate.

Accordingly, any plans that require elaborate underground bunkers or moon bases are probably a no-go.

**Constraint: We will develop plans for a community.** 

Humans are social, tribal creatures. We need each other to survive. Some people are hermits. This plan is not for hermits. This plan is for people who understand they need people and believe in cooperation for the common good. This plan is for people who want to belong to a community, and who want everyone in that community to feel like they belong.

**Constraint: The community we will plan is not only in case of emergency.**

It is not an emergency shelter. It is not a place that people will go to when the world begins to end in earnest. It is a community that can be built today, using currently-available technology and resources, where families and individuals can live and participate in the modern world. In the event that the world does not end, this community will be a sustainable, vibrant community that can still participate in the larger, specialized economy. If this community were built tomorrow, it is a place where you and I would want to move to.

This constraint allows for some interesting design opportunities. We can likely map the degradation of technology to some timetable following economic collapse. This means that the communities we design can effectively appear modern at the outset, with modern amenities and materials, but our designs should take into account the consequences of the routine failures of complex systems. Our communities can take advantage of technology while technology is still available, but should present solutions that either cope with the loss of technology or meaningfully extend its viable lifespan with sustainable practices.

**Constraint: The community must be capable of self-sufficiency in the face of global economic collapse.**

Food, water, shelter, and security. Those are the basics. Depending on the stage of collapse, we could likely add the following items: electricity, communication, medicine, tools & equipment, recreation, and one or more trade goods. This part is pretty self-explanatory. It is arguably the main constraint of any community design we would consider.

**Constraint: People are the universal currency of design.**

Let's assume for the sake of argument that the optimum community size to plan for is 120 (well within Dunbar's Number with some room to grow). How many of those will be needed to feed everyone? How many will be needed to maintain the community's buildings and equipment? How many will be needed to care for the sick and injured? How many will be needed to provide security? How many to raise and instruct children? Once we've taken care of everyone's basic needs -- how many do we have leftover, either as backups to train for those roles, or for other tasks, like the creation of trade goods. What is the optimum population age curve for the population? How far can we deviate from that curve and expect the community to still be able to take care of itself?

This constraint is more about the language of the design itself. We must be able to express the ability of the community to sustain itself based on the projected labor needs and available laborers.

**Optimization: Survival is not merely for the wealthy.**

Membership in this community should not be restricted to the wealthy. It will take resources to construct the community, and those resources will have to come from its members. Our communities will be optimized for inclusion. As a design optimization, this means that once the constraints have been met, we bend every remaining effort towards maximizing this trait. For those less familiar with design terminology, we could say that the design optimization for a racecar is speed. The constraints are the things that still make it nominally fit the definition of a car -- it has wheels and an engine, etc. The thing we're really trying to do while meeting that basic definition of a car is to make it as fast as possible. For our communities, survival as a community is the requirement, and maximum inclusivity is the goal.

I have to disclose a personal motivation here: in designing the communities that will survive the collapse, we are inevitably defining at least some small set of values that we want to survive in its wake. If you believe, as I do, that unchecked greed and selfishness in its many forms is effectively the cause of our current predicament, then you hopefully desire, as I do, for the communities that flourish in the future to be those that embrace the antithesis of those dysfunctions. Today's economy has rewarded those who have exploited most ruthlessly and efficiently the resources that are common to us all. If those values continue to be dominant after the collapse (by virtue of the fact that only those who succeeded the most at screwing all of the rest of us over have survived), we will have learned nothing and future humanity will very likely be doomed to repeat our mistakes. If you can't sign on to that, I understand. This is important to me, and I want to work with people for whom it is also important.

To prime the pump, I'll provide a short list here of questions to consider. The list is not exhaustive and your input is welcome.

## Questions:
* Community Location - describe the geographies that are best suited to constructing a resilient community that can meet its needs in a changing climate
* Community Size - what is Dunbar's Number and why is it the answer to the question of "how large should we plan for these communities to be?"
* Food - how will we sustainably feed a community of [community size]?
* Water - how will the community ensure the continuity of its water supply (likely tied closely to location as a constraint)
* Shelter - what do the common dwellings of the community look like? How will they provide sustainable heating, cooling, and enough space for members to live in comfortably?
* Security - how will the community provide security for its members, both from outside threats and inside threats?
* Electricity - what renewable, sustainable generation methods can be utilized to power the community?
* Communication - how will the community maintain communication internally and externally
* Medicine - what medicines can be grown and manufactured sustainably within the community?

## Written Contributions
**"I want to contribute,"** you say, eyes bright and head held high like the beautiful person you are.

I love you. Your enthusiasm is awesome. Here's how you can contribute:

1. Pick a topic. Maybe it's a question that's been posed here, maybe it's one that hasn't.
2. Research it thoroughly.
3. Document everything. What are the questions you asked? What are the approaches you considered? Why didn't they work? Why do you believe this approach will work? Cite everything you can.
4. Be prepared to defend your work. There may be things you didn't consider, perspectives you didn't see. Content reviewers will help ensure the completeness of your work in addition to general readability and formatting. The reviewers love you, too. They'll be nice, and they'll be thorough. It matters way more that we find the best answers to these problems than that any one person's ideas find primacy. Remember those values we're trying to build in our community? It's not about you or me. We all have to remember that.
5. Once we've accepted an entry, we'll publish it.

**"Can I be a reviewer?"** you ask, hope gleaming in your eyes.
Let's talk about that. Shoot me an [email](mailto:thatsimonsguy+collapse@gmail.com). I'd love to chat.

## Closing Thoughts
We'll probably revisit every part of this exercise multiple times in iterative fashion. We might revisit or add to our constraints. It's also likely that we'll develop multiple plans, either for multiple phases of post-collapse civilization, or for different geographical scenarios that could each yield viable communities but require different implementations.

I don't know yet what this could look like, but I want to find out. 

I hope you do, too.
